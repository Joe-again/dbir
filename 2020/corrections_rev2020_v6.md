# Corrections

## Print report  
* On page 7, Figure 4, (Summary of findings), "81% of breaches were discovered in days or less" should read "81% of breaches were contained in days or less".  Reason: Typo
* On page 15, paragraph 2, (Error) "Loss is down among the single digits this year as opposed to over 30% in 2010." should read "Loss is down among the single digits this year."  Reason: Ci for 2010 centered at 25% and very wide.  
* On page 28, paragraph 1, (Head in the clouds) "Cloud assets were involved in about 22% of breaches this year, while on-premises assets are still 71% in our reported incidents dataset" should read "Cloud assets were involved in about 24% of breaches this year, while on-premises assets are still 71% in our reported breaches dataset" Reason: incident-breach transpose.  Minor percentage correction.  
* On page 37, paragraph 2, (Crimeware) "This year has continued the trend of modest increases in incidents and breaches involving Crimeware, now up to about 300, which is higher than last year and roughly matches the highest levels that were reached in 2014." should read "This year has continued the trend of modest increases in incidents and breaches involving Crimeware, now up to about 400 breaches, which is higher than last year and the highest levels that were reached in 2015." Reason: typo in original number.  
* On page 38, paragraph 6, (Payment Card Skimmers), "Our data has shown a continuous downward trend of incidents involving Point of Sale (PoS) Card Skimmers, which are now down to 0.7% of our incident data." should be "Our data has shown a continuous downward trend of incidents involving Point of Sale (PoS) Card Skimmers, which are now down to 0.7% of our breach data." Reason: incident-breach transpose.  
* On page 39, paragraph 4, (Secondary webapp subset), "The Secondary subset represents a total of 5,831 incidents, with about 90% of them involving some form of hacking, malware and impacting servers." should be "The Secondary subset represents a total of 5,831 incidents, with greater than 90% of them involving some form of hacking, malware and impacting servers." Reason: written to median, but used lower CI.  
* On page 50, paragraph 1, (Rob the builder), "The majority of these attacks were opportunistic in nature (75%), which means that the actors who perpetrated them had a very wellcalibrated hammer they knew how to make work, and were just looking for some unprotected nails." should be "The majority of these attacks were opportunistic in nature, which means that the actors who perpetrated them had a very wellcalibrated hammer they knew how to make work, and were just looking for some unprotected nails." Reason: The 75% should not be included as the sample size is too small to support analysis of exact values.  It could be replaced with associated CI of (67%-100%).  
* On page 59, paragraph 2, (Come one, come all!), "Since 2019, Web Application attacks have increased significantly, both in terms of percentage of breaches and in raw number of incidents." should be "Since 2019, Web Application attacks have increased significantly, both in terms of percentage and raw number of breaches." Reason: incident-breach transpose.
* On page 60, paragraph 1, (You, sir, ara  phish), "Most of these attacks fall into our Everything Else pattern and account for 14% of the breaches we saw in 2019." should be "Most of these attacks fall into our Everything Else pattern and account for 16% of the breaches we saw in 2019." Reason: minor percenage change. (14% is still within the CI.)  
* On page 65, paragraph 1, (If I closed my eyes, was it still a breach?), "Since the Everything Else pattern is the largest for incidents (cases in which there was potential data disclosure but it was not confirmed), special attention is needed here." rather than "Since the Everything Else pattern is the largest for incidents (including cases in which there was potential data disclosure but it was not confirmed), special attention is needed here." Reason: non-breach incidents include, but are not limited to potential data disclsoure.  
* On page 78, paragraph 1, (All roads lead to pwnd.), "The Hacking and Social actions were the most common in this industry, which supports the Web Application pattern’s prominence." should be "The Hacking Social, and Malware actions were the most common in this industry, which supports the Web Application pattern’s prominence." Reason: statistical separation in enumerations occurs after Malware, not between Malware and Social.  
* On page 91, paragraph 1, (Northern America) "There are a couple of factors that need to be kept in mind when looking at the findings below. First of all, this region accounts for 70% of all incidents and 63% of all breaches in our dataset this year." should be "There are a couple of factors that need to be kept in mind when looking at the findings below. First of all, this region accounts for 69% of all incidents and 55% of all breaches in our dataset this year." Reason: sample was miscalculated.  
* On page 96, paragraph 1, (Europe, Middle East, and Africa) "In this instance, it mostly consists of typical Business Email Compromises (BEC) and represents 19% of the data breaches within this region" and "In this instance, it includes typical Business Email Compromises (BEC) and represents 19% of the data breaches within this region" Reason: BEC CI is not greater than 50%.  
* On page 96, paragraph 3, (Zooming out), "The second most common incident for the region was ransomware, which continues to be ubiquitous globally." should be "The second most common malware for the region was ransomware, which continues to be ubiquitous globally." Reason: The sample for the claim is malware varieties rather than all incidents.  
* On page 102, (Summary), "Actor motives are represented by percentage ranges, as only 22 incidents had a known motive." should be "Actor motives are represented by percentage ranges, as only 24 incidents had a known motive." Reason: Minor number typo.  
* On page 116, Paragraph 2, (Acknowledgement and analysis of bias), "This year, our maximum confidence is +/-1.5% for incidents and +/-0.5% for breaches, which is related to our sample size." should be "This year, our maximum confidence is +/-1.5% for breaches and +/-0.5% for incidents, which is related to our sample size." Reason: incident-breach transpose.  
* On page 117, "Kasperksy Labs" should be "Kaspersky"
* On page 117, "MWR InfoSecurity" should be "F-Secure (formerly MWR InfoSecurity)"
* On page 118, The Kaspersky Logo is out of date
* On page 118, the MWR InfoSecurity logo should be the F-Secure logo
* On page 118, the Hyderabad Security logo is out of date
* On page 97, paragraph 1, (It's the law - or not.), ", Brazil (whose data protection law is only effective since February 2020)," should be removed. Reason: Brazil's data protection law is not yet effective.
